# Golf Getaway
Inspiration: TagPro (slow and skillful momentum-based movement, fun boosts)

Next steps:
- flesh out the level to look more like mini-golf (walls, etc)
- add more balls. they should move randomly.
- ball collision.

Later:
- boosts are stored and useable with a button (like mariocart)
- game mechanic: you can do a sort of "parry" on an incoming ball. e.g. with spacebar. maybe this lets you store balls to later shoot back.
    - possible implementation: an extended, spinning radius (golf club?) around hole that the balls have to be touching to parry.

### Instructions

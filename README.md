# Golf Getaway
Inspiration: TagPro (slow and skillful momentum-based movement, fun boosts)

Next steps:
- one enemy
- one boost

Later:
- boosts are stored and useable with a button (like mariocart)

### Instructions
1. start the game
```zsh
npm run dev
```

2. visit http://localhost:3000/

reminders:
- hard-refresh the browser each time you make changes (e.g. cmd + shift + R in chrome on mac)
- check errors in the browser console (e.g. cmd + opt + J in chrome on mac)
